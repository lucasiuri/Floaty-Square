# Floaty-Square

First prototype of a Flappy Bird inspired game developed in VHDL and Quartus 20 for Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA board using its VGA. It features a square that when the action butto is pressed goes up and when it is released the gravity acts upon it making it fall. The obstacles traverse the window and the space between them are of fixed size and randomly positioned. When the square hits a wall the game stops and has to be reset. The square never go out of the window.
